		<p>Nola Musicians for Palestine invites all bands, musicians, artists, and community organizations to participate in our first “New Orleans Solidarity Fest,” which will run alongside Jazz Fest from April 25th to May 6th. As we continue to bear witness to the genocide in Gaza, this festival aims to channel the creative and celebratory energy of our city into demonstrations of solidarity toward a new world.</p>
		<p>We are inviting organizations to 1.) Formally endorse and promote the Solidarity Festival, 2.) Join us for a procession on May 4th outside of Jazz Fest, 3.) Organize an event (of any size), or add your existing event to the festival calendar 4.) volunteer to help us table/outreach at our events during the festival, and 5) provide resources about your organization that you'd like to be at those outreach tables.</p>
		<p>We are inviting bands, musicians, and artists to 1.) add your show/event to the Solidarity Fest calendar! (this would include letting us set up a table to conduct outreach at the event). 2.) Make an announcement informing your audience of the outreach table, local organizing efforts, and how they can plug in (this is also an opportunity to share any thoughts about why your band is participating), 3.) Wear keffiyehs if you have them! 4.) Lastly, let us know if you’d like to learn and perform a Palestinian tune at your event and we can share music/charts with you.</p>
